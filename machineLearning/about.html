               <h2>Why this Project Was Made</h2>
               <p>As a student, this had been my first time exploring topics within machine learning. However, I have always been interested in how machines process human language. Therefore, I chose to explore this interest by creating this project.</p>
               <p>This project is also an exploration into using computers to create art. I was inspired by various texts generated by computers, and how these mimic our own language. Therefore, this project plays off of this idea to create something which users can easily test how a computer may calculate the relation between our words.</p>
               <h2>How this Project Was Created</h2>
               <p>This project utilizes ML5.JS, a JavaScript library managed by NYU ITP which offers multiple AI models which are ready to use along with tutorials to make your own. In particular, I used ML5's Word2Vec model to track the distance between words. Whenever an input is given, I have used word2vec to find the next closes word, which I then have the computer output for the user to see. </p>
               <h2>Further Uses for this Project</h2>
               <p>Word vectors -- vector mapping of words-- are being used in many different ways. Perhaps the most notable use is in translating one language to another. If we can get a machine to fully understand the meaning behind our words, then we can also utilize this technology in a gamut of ways.</p>
